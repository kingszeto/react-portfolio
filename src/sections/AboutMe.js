                I'm a junior computer science major minoring in mathematics at <a href='https://www.ics.uci.edu'>UC Irvine</a> graduating 
                early 2022. I'm an aspiring back-end software engineer, but I'm giving front-end a shot with this 
                website. I experience the full-stack through the numerous hackathons I've attended, and recently I was able to
                help organize the very first hackathon I attended!

                For some reason though, those restless nights of debugging projects made under the California... <em>moon </em> 
                made me eager to apply to the <a href='https://hackny.org/fellows-program'>HackNY 2021 Fellowship</a>, which is 
                where I'll be spending my summer!
